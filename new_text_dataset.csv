"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",surprise
"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",surprise
"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",joy
"So you might say, it’s a magic ring.",joy
OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!,surprise
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.,neutral
"Obviously! So, how do we decide?",neutral
"Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her",neutral
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,neutral
"That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her",joy
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction,neutral
"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",neutral
Yeah well we should order some food then.,neutral
"No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll",neutral
That sounds fair.,neutral
Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street,neutral
Ah yeah—wait a second now!,anger
Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.,neutral
I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,anger
"Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.",neutral
"All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.",neutral
So let’s decide on the spending limit,neutral
"Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars?",neutral
I was thinking more like a hundred.,neutral
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?,neutral
"Hi, again.",neutral
Hey!,neutral

As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years.,neutral
You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!,joy

"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",neutral
"Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!",joy
"Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",neutral
"Yes, I realize that",neutral
"And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",neutral
I love working with designers!,joy
"With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?",neutral

"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?",neutral
"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.",neutral
"Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.",joy
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,surprise

Me too!,joy
"First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me",joy
"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",joy

"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",neutral
Yes!!! Oh!!,joy
Hypothetically!,anger
Still.,neutral
If Phoebe were my maid of honor,neutral
"Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",neutral

It's not just the drum noise.,neutral
"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",anger
"Oh god, my eye!""",anger
"I mean, it is so annoying.",anger
"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",neutral
"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",surprise
Maybe on some level.,neutral
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,surprise

Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!,surprise
