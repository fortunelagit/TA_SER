"Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.",neutral
"Ohh, it’s time to go.",neutral
You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you,neutral

That’s not a state Joe.,neutral
"Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.",neutral

"Yeah, then you did that.",neutral
"I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.",neutral
I thought you already have a job.,neutral
"Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don’t!",neutral

"Um, that's it.",neutral
"Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.",neutral
"No. Sweetie, you’re gonna be fine.",neutral
Really.,neutral
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,neutral
"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?",neutral
So what are you gonna do?,neutral
"I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’",neutral
Good!,neutral
"Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.",neutral

Pat Sajak?,neutral
"Okay, now much have you won so far?",neutral
Hey guys!,neutral

"Oh, y'know..",neutral
How do I look?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.",neutral
"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",neutral
How did this happen?,neutral
Okay. Let’s bring it in.,neutral
Okay. Let’s move on.,neutral
I,neutral
"I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.",neutral
But,neutral
"Oh, ah- the kid has it.",neutral
Well I hope you have fun tonight.,neutral
"Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.",neutral
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?,neutral
I’ll see you later.,neutral
"Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.",neutral
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.,neutral

Sure.,neutral
There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there?,neutral

I don’t believe this!!,neutral
You've got to be smooth about it.,neutral
"It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.",neutral
You know where I work!,neutral
No.,neutral
PBS Telethon.,neutral
I’m sorry.,neutral
"Ah well, this is the living room.",neutral
All I really needed was a plan.,neutral
"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!",neutral
Just tell me how.,neutral
"Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.",neutral
"All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.",neutral
"Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.",neutral
"Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.",neutral
"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.",neutral
Those are dead serious.,neutral
"Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.",neutral
"Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.",neutral
Well! Good night.  I’m going upstairs.,neutral

No. Nothing.,neutral
Well what happened at dinner?,neutral
"I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number.",neutral
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?,neutral
"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?",neutral
"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"He's good with rear things, bring him in too.",neutral
"All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.",neutral
"Yeah, but wait...",neutral
"Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.",neutral
New people.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Haul ass!!!,neutral
"Yeah, okay, Scott!",neutral
"Okay, one thing at a time.",neutral
"Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",neutral
That sounds fair.,neutral
"Ross, I really don’t think",neutral
"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",neutral
I’m gonna get coffee.,neutral
"All right, Julie.",neutral
"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.",neutral
I dropped a cup.,neutral
"Yeah, most of it it's a place",neutral
"Okay that’s, you know what that is?",neutral
Kate Miller it is.,neutral
"Oh, is the play over?",neutral
We will.,neutral

"Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.",neutral
And a nice hot cider for Monica.,neutral
That is how God intended it.,neutral
You're hot.,neutral
Who knows?,neutral
Electrical plans for the building.,neutral
Thank you.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.",neutral
How needy do I want to seem?,neutral
"But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.",neutral
"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.",neutral
"Oh-no, he’s right.",neutral
"Well, you never told me how old you were.",neutral
"Oh yeah, no problem.",neutral
Here I am.,neutral
"And y'know, and um, I...",neutral
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?,neutral
Nothing..Why?,neutral
"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.",neutral
"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.",neutral
You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty?,neutral
"Listen, um...",neutral
C'mon in.,neutral
"Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them.",neutral
"So to sum up, I’m Professor Geller.",neutral
"Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.",neutral
I,neutral
Come on.,neutral
"Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",neutral
Power saw kinda got away from me there.,neutral
Maybe she can give me a pill or something.,neutral
Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.,neutral
Was the chord at least right,neutral
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.,neutral
"Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.",neutral
"No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.",neutral
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?,neutral
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Um-hmm.,neutral
"Alright, no, we could look at them!",neutral
Not right now.,neutral
"Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.",neutral
This is a hospital.,neutral
"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?",neutral
Nothing!,neutral
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.,neutral
I'm sure they'll be here soon.,neutral
"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",neutral
As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years.,neutral
"Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.",neutral
"Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.",neutral
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?,neutral
Isn’t there a national football league.,neutral
"Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.",neutral
"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.",neutral
"Quack, quack..",neutral
"I miss Janice though.  ""Hello, Chandler Bing.""",neutral
Ohh.,neutral
"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this.",neutral
"Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.",neutral
"Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?",neutral
No it's not.,neutral
"Hey, you're not rich are ya?",neutral
"Hi, here's the deal.",neutral
I think that a person should know where they come from.,neutral
Where were you?,neutral
How good is that?,neutral
We- we had our first fight this morning.,neutral
"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.",neutral
"You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening.  Yeah we are.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.",neutral
And that’s how it’s done.,neutral
For my last birthday you gave me a,neutral

"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.",neutral
"Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them.",neutral
"Hey, don’t we have to...",neutral
"Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.",neutral
"Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...",neutral
We'll give you Janice.,neutral
"Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.",neutral
"You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.",neutral
Isn’t he an architect now?,neutral

"So then, are you going to dump Jason?",neutral
"Umm, I am free tomorrow night.",neutral
"Well, yeah, now.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
So it'll be either you two  or you two.,neutral
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?,neutral
A two and a five.,neutral
"Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.",neutral
Can you just hold on for one minute?,neutral
"There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.",neutral
"That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!",neutral
Okay what’s up?,neutral
Hi guys.,neutral

All right.,neutral
"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.",neutral
"You’re an Aquarius, huh?",neutral

"But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".",neutral
How did it go?,neutral
Ok.,neutral
Phonetically?,neutral
"Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.",neutral
Great nap.,neutral

"Yeah, we got, um-hmm.",neutral
"You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the boxes.",neutral
"Actually, it’s just bag.",neutral
"Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.",neutral
"Uhh, the ball thing.",neutral

You’re welcome.,neutral
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.,neutral
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.,neutral
‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?,neutral
"Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.",neutral
"Oh, Mon, sure.",neutral
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.,neutral
It’s 6:00.,neutral
"C'mon, this is us.",neutral
"All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke.",neutral
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.,neutral
Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,neutral
"This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing",neutral
I bet it’s fast.,neutral
I know.,neutral
That’s no problem.,neutral
"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.",neutral
I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.,neutral

Why?,neutral
"I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.",neutral
"Look, you and I went to different high schools...",neutral
"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.",neutral

Just a touch.,neutral
"Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.",neutral

No.,neutral
For him.,neutral
Dr. Oberman.,neutral
Nice to meet you too.,neutral
"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",neutral
What you don’t think I’d go up to her?,neutral
Your mom called me. So is this her?,neutral
"Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.",neutral
"Either, it makes no difference.",neutral
Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?,neutral
"Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.",neutral
"Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean.""",neutral
What was with the dishes?,neutral
"Oh, well I tell Issac everything.",neutral
"Here's the thing, Janice.",neutral
"All right, let's try one.",neutral
Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas?,neutral
"Pheebs, what about you?",neutral
Okay that’s fair.,neutral
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.,neutral
And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time.,neutral

"Oh, yeah.",neutral
"So, if we could just get back to the lecture.",neutral
I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.,neutral
Why? What happened to him?,neutral
Oh then you know each other.,neutral
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.,neutral
How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?,neutral
Sperm or regular?,neutral
"Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.",neutral
"And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.",neutral
Refill?,neutral

You got it?,neutral
"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",neutral
"Ah actually, that is mine.",neutral
"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.",neutral
It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.,neutral
"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",neutral
All right.,neutral
Careful of the angle.,neutral
"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",neutral

"Okay, then.",neutral
"No, you are not. We tell you stuff.",neutral
"Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?",neutral

They're nice guys.,neutral
"Well, here's your phone doctor.",neutral
"You're independent, and you always have been!",neutral
I think the check in is that way.,neutral
"Phoebe, we’re getting",neutral
I’m calling for Monica Geller.,neutral
"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.",neutral
"Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.",neutral
Maybe. Does that scare ya?,neutral
"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-",neutral
"Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?",neutral
Die Hard 2,neutral
"Hey, somebody left their keys.",neutral
That I did. That I did.,neutral

Are you moving out?,neutral
"Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?",neutral
"Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?",neutral

"No, just a Friday night.",neutral
"So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.",neutral

"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",neutral
Chandler.,neutral
"Hey, waiter.",neutral
"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?",neutral
"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",neutral
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.,neutral
No.,neutral
Bijan for men?,neutral
"When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",neutral
"Oh, that must be it.",neutral
What?,neutral
How ya doin’?,neutral

Mm! Night Gar’!,neutral
"Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.",neutral
"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?",neutral

"Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!",neutral
"Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?",neutral
"Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back.",neutral
See?,neutral
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?,neutral

Pretty nice?,neutral
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?,neutral
"Look, you guys wanna meet the group?",neutral
"Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?",neutral
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.,neutral
And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.,neutral
Like it would help.,neutral
Hi Joey.,neutral
"I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.",neutral
"Eh, worth a shot.  Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?",neutral

"Honey, I love you too.",neutral

Uh-huh.,neutral
"And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed.",neutral
"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.",neutral
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am,neutral

Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.,neutral
"Okay, I can do this.",neutral
"Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",neutral
Pretty much.,neutral
"Now you do that, you’re on TV.",neutral

"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",neutral
"Honey, it’s gonna be okay.",neutral
Okay?,neutral

"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames.",neutral
"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.",neutral
"I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.",neutral
It's like a gift.,neutral
I think I may be able to book,neutral
"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.",neutral
"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn.",neutral
You guys make a,neutral

"Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?",neutral
I don’t think you have much choice.,neutral
Chandler.,neutral
"Look, I don’t think so Pheebs.  All right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend.",neutral
"With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?",neutral

You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?,neutral
We’re you just ten seconds later!,neutral

"Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.",neutral
So you're a chef?,neutral
"Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it.",neutral

Uh-huh.,neutral
"So, what do you think?",neutral
"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.",neutral
"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.",neutral

"Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.",neutral
"We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",neutral
"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..",neutral
Mmm.,neutral
I can fix it. Hold on.  Look out. Look out.,neutral
"Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.",neutral
"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.",neutral
She's checking the coats.,neutral
Oh okay. But y’know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.,neutral
"Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.",neutral
"I don't know, what were the names I just said?",neutral
"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",neutral
"Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies.",neutral
Okay?,neutral

"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.",neutral
"No. Joey, she",neutral

"Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.",neutral
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.,neutral
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.,neutral
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,neutral
"Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.",neutral
Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.,neutral
"No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.",neutral
"No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.",neutral
So that’s the only reason she could be here huh?,neutral
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.,neutral
What is it?,neutral
"Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.",neutral
"Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger.",neutral

"I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.",neutral
"Uh, uh.",neutral
Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.,neutral
I know. Thanks.,neutral
"Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register, and",neutral
"Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",neutral
"I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.",neutral
"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.",neutral
"Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.",neutral
"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?",neutral
"Oh, we have some",neutral
"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.",neutral
"Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8.",neutral
"Why not a Yugoslavian?""",neutral
All right.,neutral
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.,neutral
I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!,neutral
"Okay, then what happened?",neutral
"Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?",neutral
Is that true miss?,neutral
"Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.",neutral
Did you hear that?!,neutral
"Okay, who’s next?!",neutral
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.,neutral
And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.,neutral
"Actually I ah, I am a poet.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Well, we’re starving, why don’t we all go get something to eat?",neutral
"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.",neutral
"Well, we are great guys.",neutral
"Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.",neutral
Need some help?,neutral
Maybe on some level.,neutral
"No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.",neutral
"Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.",neutral
"Yeah, can I help you with something?",neutral
"Ok, you can do this.",neutral
"No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.",neutral
"Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.",neutral
Bad things happen to me anyway.,neutral
"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.",neutral
"Hey come on now, this is a real date.",neutral
This is about us.,neutral
What? Is it the comet?,neutral
"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.",neutral

And-,neutral
"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?",neutral
I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,neutral
"Well, Chandler will be there for you too.",neutral
"Let's see, she's on the third floor",neutral
I don’t think I should say.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",neutral
"Ooh, dude. That’s not gonna happen.",neutral
Would she?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
I gotta side with Chandler on this one.,neutral
Good bye!,neutral
"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",neutral

"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.",neutral
"Oh, Rachel.",neutral

"Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?",neutral
"And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.",neutral
"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.",neutral
Next on Ross... Uh-oh.,neutral
"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.",neutral
"Uhh, Rachel, my parents",neutral
"Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.",neutral
She could be you.,neutral
"Hey Gunther, these yours?",neutral
Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.,neutral
Totally.,neutral

Yeah.,neutral
"Hmm, noodle soup.",neutral
"So it’s y’know, it’s uh, it’s cool.",neutral
"Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?",neutral
Oh! We could have done that.,neutral
"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
Steady.,neutral
I knew.,neutral
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.,neutral
That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Thank you.,neutral
"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.",neutral
Hey. Who’s that?,neutral
Hey.,neutral
He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?,neutral
We did?,neutral
"Phoebe, what is it?",neutral
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?,neutral
"Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century.",neutral
Absolutely.,neutral
We got some,neutral
I just called a friend of mine.,neutral
"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!",neutral
But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here.,neutral
"Can't do it, can you?",neutral
I’ll call you from Tulsa.,neutral
Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?,neutral
"Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,",neutral
"I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...",neutral
"Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?",neutral
We should always always break up together.,neutral
I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear!,neutral
"No, I haven't seen him.",neutral
"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.",neutral
"Uh, Paul’s Café. They got great food and it’s really romantic.",neutral
"Understood. So, what’d you say back then?",neutral
"Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.",neutral
"Umm, oh here—Do you want a good one?",neutral
"Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.",neutral
So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.,neutral
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.,neutral
"Oh no it’s fine, don’t worry about it.",neutral
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry.,neutral
"Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.",neutral
"Okay, here comes another camera.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
I did it anyway.,neutral
I’ll really appreciate it.,neutral
"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.",neutral
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.,neutral
I don’t know Rach.,neutral
"Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?",neutral
"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.",neutral
"Oh right, right.",neutral
"Okay.  Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning.  So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.",neutral
What?,neutral
What about these? These look the same?,neutral
What do you like better action or comedy?,neutral
I can blow dry it.,neutral
...Joe.,neutral
"Joey, you look nothing like Ben.",neutral
I guess so.,neutral
Can't wait.,neutral
"Hi, I’m Joshua, I’m here to pick up Rachel.",neutral

Chloe? Hi..,neutral
"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.",neutral
"So, see ya on Saturday.",neutral

This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,neutral
"Oh, you want something serious.",neutral
"Okay, I’ll be out in a second.",neutral
"Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.",neutral
"Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.",neutral
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Pheebs...,neutral
"Yeah,  oh, but oh...",neutral
Really?,neutral
"A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.",neutral
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?,neutral
"Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes.",neutral
Y’know what would work?,neutral
No problem.,neutral
"So… Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.",neutral
Mr. Heckles.,neutral
It's a four.,neutral
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?,neutral
Can you do that for me?,neutral
Thanks.,neutral
So… We go eat.,neutral
"When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.",neutral
All right?,neutral
"No, you're the best.",neutral
Just take him to like a ball game or something.,neutral
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!,neutral
"Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.",neutral
"Well, I didn’t realize until I got home.",neutral
You still love me.,neutral
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.,neutral
Joey? What’s up?,neutral
If you wanna put a label on it.,neutral
"Ooh, very official.",neutral
"I mean really, think about it.",neutral
Mm-Hm,neutral
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.,neutral
Come on.,neutral
"Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.",neutral
"Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s",neutral
Okay. This stuff?,neutral
Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.,neutral
"Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?",neutral
"Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.",neutral
I’m reading your ad.,neutral
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.,neutral
"So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?",neutral
"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",neutral
"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.",neutral
"Stunning entertainment center. Fine,  fine Italian craftsmanship.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
No you answer it and take pledges.,neutral
I'm..,neutral
"Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at",neutral
"David, I'm pretending to",neutral
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.,neutral
"Well, not right now.",neutral
"I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later.",neutral
"Thanks, any suggestions?",neutral
"Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team.",neutral
Which one do you think she is?,neutral
"Hey, tell ya what.",neutral
"Look, you and I have been given a gift.",neutral
"Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.",neutral
"Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.",neutral
"No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here.  Lily, from high school. Remember?",neutral
"And then you said, ""Why do they call it a check?",neutral
"Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale.",neutral
"Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right.",neutral
"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so",neutral
"But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",neutral
What are you saying I should do?,neutral
"Do you uh, do you talk about me?",neutral
"So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?",neutral
"Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, sure.",neutral
Hi! Bye!,neutral
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?,neutral
You guys wanna get some coffee?,neutral
"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?",neutral
"Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.",neutral
"No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.",neutral
So much more.,neutral
"Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.",neutral
"Umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk?",neutral
"Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!",neutral
"You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!",neutral
"I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.",neutral
"Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.",neutral
People make mistakes!,neutral
Well yeah,neutral
Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.,neutral
"You’ll wear that. We’ll be eating, and of course, you’ll be wearing that.",neutral
"Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",neutral
"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else?",neutral
"Hey, you're not him.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
No.,neutral
About what?,neutral
"So, Ross and I are going to",neutral
"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",neutral
"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?",neutral
"And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.",neutral
You mean Dr. Geller?,neutral
Hey!,neutral
"No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy.",neutral
So you work at,neutral
"Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler.",neutral
"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.",neutral
"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.",neutral
You're our third call tonight.,neutral
I’m sorry I’m a little late.,neutral
"Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
You’re right.,neutral
I think that would be best.,neutral
"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.",neutral
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.,neutral
Are you okay?,neutral
"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",neutral
There are a couple of forms to fill out.,neutral
Her dying wish was for one last kiss.,neutral
"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?",neutral
"I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows.",neutral
Yeah!,neutral
"Umm, why don't you give",neutral
In-in three minutes.,neutral
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have",neutral
"Yeah, for you. Is that the list?",neutral
I’m Trudie.,neutral

"I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.",neutral
"Well, thank you for lunch.",neutral
"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.",neutral
"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.",neutral
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-,neutral
These things happen!,neutral
"All right, I'm nine years old.",neutral
"Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?",neutral
It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.,neutral
I know,neutral
"Uh, middle balcony.",neutral
"Joey, we have something to tell you.",neutral

"Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.",neutral
"Ohh, okay.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn’t tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?",neutral
Okay?,neutral
Are you hot?,neutral
"Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.",neutral
"Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.",neutral
Ross.,neutral
"Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.",neutral
Here.,neutral
"All right, I'll try not to.",neutral
I don't know.,neutral
It was cheesecake.,neutral
Won't you dance around with me.,neutral
You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.,neutral
"Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.",neutral
Another,neutral
I’ll try.,neutral
I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.,neutral
"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.",neutral
"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.",neutral
Better think of a new name for him.,neutral
"We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -",neutral
"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I’m having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.",neutral
"Well, I-I could live without it.",neutral
That’s-that’s the real question.,neutral
"Okay, I'll stop.",neutral
"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.",neutral
I am,neutral
"Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.",neutral
Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment.,neutral
Oh May 15,neutral
Dime.,neutral
"Oh, he needed some time to grieve.",neutral
"And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.",neutral
"I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?",neutral
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?,neutral
"Um,  Barry.",neutral
Nothing at all.,neutral
Is there anything we can do for you?,neutral
"Okay, I’m not gonna have one.",neutral
Ok!,neutral
"All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.",neutral
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression,neutral
"I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.",neutral
Kind of what ‘probably’ really means.,neutral
‘Cause you’re still into Monica.,neutral
You take care Jill.,neutral
"You should ah, you should just leave it.",neutral
"Uh, like, could these margaritas",neutral
"Oh yeah, that looks good.",neutral
One swift kick and he’ll back off.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Me too.,neutral
"That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.",neutral
"Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?",neutral
Oh no thanks. I don’t like,neutral
"Oh, then no.",neutral
You,neutral

"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.",neutral
Hello?,neutral
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?,neutral
"Yeah, I understand.",neutral
"Uh, that was your sister actually.",neutral
What's your point?,neutral
Rdtor.,neutral
What are you up too?,neutral
Here.,neutral
"All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",neutral
Later.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
What for?,neutral
"Dude, you have got to turn on",neutral
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it —now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?,neutral
Hello.,neutral
"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",neutral
"I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Even if he were... cornered?,neutral
"Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?",neutral
"Almost! But first, we gotta start.",neutral
Okay!,neutral
"Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.",neutral
"So uh, do you live around here?",neutral
"Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal.",neutral
"Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now.",neutral
"Oh, okay, y’know what this is?",neutral
"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.",neutral
"Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.",neutral
"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.",neutral
Sorry.,neutral
"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.",neutral
Are you're hands still wet?,neutral
"Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.",neutral
"All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",neutral
"Oh believe me, I-I-I’ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.",neutral
I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high.,neutral
"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.",neutral
"Obviously! So, how do we decide?",neutral
I,neutral
"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.",neutral
"It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.",neutral
"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!",neutral
Check this out. Can I have this?,neutral
Exactly.,neutral
She’d-she’d love this.,neutral
What message?,neutral
"10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....",neutral

"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.",neutral
"Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.",neutral
"Y'know, someplace nice.",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
How are you feeling?,neutral
"Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.",neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?",neutral
"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.",neutral
But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment.,neutral
"Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.",neutral
"No, I don’t think so.",neutral
It's Phoebe.,neutral
"Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.",neutral
"Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.",neutral
Who cares about them.,neutral
"Ho-ho, I will.",neutral
"Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.",neutral
She lives so close.,neutral
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.,neutral
I’ll be right with you.,neutral
I need some milk.,neutral
What do you mean?,neutral
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?,neutral
"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",neutral
Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.,neutral
"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.",neutral
"Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.",neutral
Maybe.,neutral
"Well, what about you?",neutral
Is there any chance you didn’t see that?,neutral
"You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",neutral
"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",neutral
"Okay, what do you guys think?",neutral
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.,neutral
There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.,neutral
"Uh, moist, yeah.",neutral
I don't know.,neutral
"Ben, you ready?",neutral
I think I know that girl.,neutral
"Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.",neutral
Do you love her?,neutral
"Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.",neutral
I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.,neutral
"All right Chandler, you’re up.",neutral
"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?",neutral
"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match.",neutral
"I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?",neutral
You're right.,neutral
No. I’m saying it’s now.,neutral
The money will turn up!,neutral
"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.",neutral
"Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Hey, Pheebs.",neutral
Hi Joey.,neutral
So how'd it go?,neutral
"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.",neutral
Good.  I should really start wearing hats!,neutral
"No, I’m good.",neutral
"I don’t know, I’m still pretty tired out from this afternoon.",neutral
"Monica, you go to the head of the class.",neutral
Otherwise it's just cruel.,neutral
"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",neutral

In the hall.,neutral
"Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.",neutral
"I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?",neutral
Right.,neutral

"Okay, Chandler!",neutral
Sounds nice.,neutral
Do you know anything about women?,neutral
You don't have to explain.,neutral
"Ugh, she",neutral
"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.",neutral
How much did ever really win before?,neutral
"All right, gimme the baby.",neutral
"When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",neutral
Uhh….,neutral
But there’ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.,neutral
Nope. Going to the,neutral

Hey.,neutral

More than jewelry.,neutral
I’m still on the set!,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Okay to come in?,neutral
Yeah! Look!,neutral
Not interested in that.,neutral
Lusts of the flesh.,neutral
She.,neutral

"Um-hmm, five actually.",neutral
"Yeah, yeah, that's her.",neutral
"Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.",neutral
Nothing! It's an expression.,neutral
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.,neutral
"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.",neutral
"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.",neutral
Let’s give it a shot.,neutral
Sparkly.,neutral

She might be able to do better.,neutral
"Yeah, we’re gonna go.",neutral
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.,neutral

"Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?",neutral
Let’s go watch it at your place.,neutral
I’d really prefer a mountain bike.,neutral
Because I’m going to London.,neutral
"But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",neutral
"Rach, I got a message from you.",neutral
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?,neutral
"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",neutral
"No, you're the best.",neutral
Which puts,neutral

"Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time.",neutral
Not in my head.,neutral
"Yeah, listen...",neutral
About paleontology.,neutral
"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.",neutral
Y’know what?,neutral
Waaay too special.,neutral
"Yeah, I’m sorry man.  You wanna go watch?",neutral

"Well, umm, not much.",neutral
"So, um, what do you do for a living?",neutral
"Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?",neutral
"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.",neutral
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.,neutral
Hey,neutral
"But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.",neutral
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most,neutral
"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.",neutral
"Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.",neutral
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.,neutral
How about Mama Lisettie's?,neutral
"Hey, uh, you can ignore that.",neutral
"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon.",neutral
Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off.,neutral
"I mean, that’s got to come in handy",neutral
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.,neutral
Sure. So how long you been...,neutral
"Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua.",neutral
"No, I don’t want to hit you.",neutral
"Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things.",neutral
"Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.",neutral
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.,neutral
"Well, okay, so what’s now—go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.",neutral
Bye-bye Julie.,neutral

"You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!",neutral
"I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there.",neutral
"Yeah, y’know the license plate game?",neutral
"So, how many have you sold so far?",neutral

Yeah.,neutral
"Oh. Look, just friends, I won’t grope you. I promise.",neutral
"No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.",neutral
I know.,neutral
"Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should.",neutral
"But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.",neutral
But then this guy’s right after him.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Wait here. Breathe.,neutral
"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.",neutral
"Yeah, it’s a very large plane.",neutral
So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?,neutral
You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.,neutral
"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!",neutral
"I can't, I gotta go.",neutral
What happened?,neutral
Phoebe?,neutral
I can’t figure out what to make Monica.,neutral
"Umm, okay, okay, look.",neutral
"Yeah, maybe.",neutral

"Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.",neutral
"Ah, oh, hang on a second.  Come in, come in.  All right, so think about it, and call me back.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",neutral
"No, thank you.",neutral
Tho?,neutral
"Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?",neutral
Let’s.,neutral
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.,neutral
"It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?",neutral
No.  This is my red sweater.,neutral

"So, you’re just Bing?",neutral
No.,neutral
"Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?",neutral
"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...",neutral
"Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it’s his first time.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",neutral
Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.,neutral
Oh all right.,neutral
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Alright. What's the message?,neutral
She didn't feel anything for him.,neutral
"Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a",neutral
A beard and a moustache.,neutral
The next next?,neutral
Triskaidekaphobia.,neutral
What happened to the Disgustingtons?,neutral
"Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?",neutral
"Sure, what do you got?",neutral
"I'm right, right?",neutral
Uh huh?,neutral
"Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.",neutral
What's this?,neutral
Or an uncle...,neutral
"No, let's just leave the lights on.",neutral
"I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me?",neutral
"All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.",neutral
We’re on a semi-first name basis.,neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
What’s the second part of your plan?,neutral
"Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready",neutral
"Yes, but y'know what?",neutral
What do ya say? What do ya say?,neutral
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.,neutral
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?,neutral
"Well, it’s getting late.",neutral

"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.",neutral
"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?",neutral
"We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.",neutral
What?,neutral
Just ignore them.,neutral
"Okay, well then how about a handshake?",neutral
"Well, I brought the next best thing.",neutral
Yep.,neutral
Joey...,neutral
"Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Yes, please!  So, what's going on?",neutral
Nope.,neutral
"Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.",neutral
I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.,neutral
Do they wait for me to do this?,neutral
We’re just gonna be friends.,neutral
"Don’t worry about that man, that happens.",neutral
"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.",neutral
"But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.",neutral
The British are coming?,neutral
And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to,neutral
Take as much time as you want.,neutral

Okay. 1…2…3—Go!   I’m gonna kill myself!,neutral
"Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.",neutral
Human spleeeen.,neutral
If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"Alright, somebody.",neutral
Her answer machine?,neutral
"Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.",neutral
I don’t think you could ever do that.,neutral
Who?,neutral
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.,neutral
"Joey, do you have a minute?",neutral
"Oh, I'd like that.",neutral
I used to,neutral
"Okay, sorry. Yeah.",neutral
"I mean, come on, buddy, get a",neutral
"But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.",neutral
I talk to you and it’s nothin’.,neutral
"Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes",neutral
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.,neutral
You gotta take care of yourselves!,neutral
"Mon, I don't understand.",neutral
"Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her",neutral
No.,neutral
"Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.",neutral
"She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?",neutral

Hi there.,neutral
And an assistant.,neutral
Hold on.,neutral
"Right, oh yeah.",neutral
He’s not really my type.,neutral
"Umm, no. No.",neutral
Huh?,neutral
"Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.",neutral
Like your sweater.,neutral
Wait!  Okay!,neutral
"I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",neutral
Monica.,neutral
It's not just the drum noise.,neutral
Remembered what?,neutral
Okay. Sorry.,neutral

"Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?",neutral

"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",neutral
Why don’t I take you out?,neutral

"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?",neutral

But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.,neutral
"Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!",neutral

Like I have nothing better to do!,neutral
"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a",neutral
"Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.",neutral
"That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.",neutral
"Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.",neutral

"Yeah, it’s  mine.",neutral
"Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?",neutral
"Look, I’ve been thinking about it.",neutral

"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",neutral
As were you.,neutral
"Weeeell, it's rum, and-",neutral

You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.,neutral
"Okay, thank you.",neutral
How can I help you?,neutral
I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.,neutral
Well so?,neutral
"Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and",neutral
I can do that.,neutral
You've been counting wrong.,neutral
"Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.",neutral
Thank you for calling attention to our error.,neutral
"Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.",neutral
"Yes, hello.",neutral
Maybe one of them will break away.,neutral
I think it just fell off.,neutral
"What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?",neutral
"See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually.",neutral
"I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.",neutral
Hey guys.,neutral

"The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.",neutral
With who?,neutral
"Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.",neutral
Men are here.,neutral
Now that is funny.,neutral
Maybe we should check the trash chute.,neutral

Maybe you can tell me.,neutral
"I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.",neutral
"So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.",neutral
Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?,neutral
"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.",neutral
"Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.",neutral
At least you know her name.,neutral

I really think they’re out of rooms.,neutral
"Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.",neutral
"So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.",neutral
No problem.,neutral

I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?,neutral
"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.",neutral
I guess I'm done.,neutral
"I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world.",neutral
"Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.",neutral
"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.",neutral
Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.,neutral
"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",neutral
"Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.",neutral
I’m your mother.,neutral
"Well I’m, I’m a little slow.  Just as our children would be.",neutral

It’s not that bad.,neutral
I just had sex.,neutral
"Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.",neutral
Because the kids need new shoes.,neutral
Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.,neutral
He’s looking at me.,neutral
Does it have to do with Joey?,neutral
"Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay.",neutral

"Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",neutral
"Oh Joey, I’m hardly a",neutral
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.,neutral

"Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.",neutral
I came to give you this  and this.,neutral

Hi.,neutral
Anything at all.,neutral
That’s not a bad idea.,neutral

Why?,neutral
Okay. Let’s use this brush.,neutral
Yeah. Where were you?,neutral
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?,neutral

"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.",neutral
"Okay, relax, relax.",neutral
"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?",neutral
